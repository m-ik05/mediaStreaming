What should be returned after running the program:

Content was never seen yet!
Content was never seen yet!
Content is unavailable for user!
End of tests

The first three messages are not errors, they actually show that the program is working correctly and not letting like or dislike shows that were not watched (lines 113-118 in testing.cpp). The third message comes from test on line 149 in testing.cpp, when the program tries to add content that is not yet available to the user.
